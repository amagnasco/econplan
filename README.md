Open-sourced lesson plan for basic heterodox political economy; a field guide of sorts

Objective: A freely available basic lesson plan for those wishing to study political economy through a quantitative heterodox perspective. This includes the questioning of the basic assumptions underlying most economics, as well as analyses based on bounded-rationality interests, intersectional identities, and complex institutions.

Context: As of early 02017, I am attempting to prepare myself for graduate studies in Economics. The challenges faced, and the solutions implemented:

1) My mathematics knowledge in general, and quantitative economics knowledge in specific, are sorely lacking. Mathematics was always a weak point in my education, something I failed to correct until this point. The resources I use to get up to speed will be a major part of this.

2) The economics taught in most textbooks and schools bears little, if any, resemblance to reality. The increasingly oblivious followers of the Friedmanite orthodoxy now span the political spectrum, causing havoc as they attempt to disengage economics from the realm of policy. Given the difficulty of finding these resources, I will do my best to compile here what I find.

3) The third issue is how to balance consolidating these resources into one cohesive unit, while maintaining the depth necessary to comprehensively learn the subject at hand. The jury's still out on that one.

I would deeply appreciate any corrections, comments, or suggestions for improvement!
